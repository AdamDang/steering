# Kubernetes Steering Committee Charter

This document outlines the mission, scope, and objectives of the Kubernetes steering committee.

## Mission

The role of the steering committee is to instantiate the formal process
for Kubernetes governance. In addition to defining the governance
process, it is important to provide a means for iterating on processes 
defined by the steering committee.  The role of the steering committee 
is to be a live, responsive body that can refactor and reform as necessary 
to adapt to a changing project and community.

## Scope and Objectives
The Steering Committee has a set of rights and responsibilities including the
following:

* Decide which project subgroups are responsible for each area of the project
  and to delegate appropriate authority those groups.
* Define, evolve, and defend the vision, values, mission, and scope of the
  project.
* Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups (including
  Special Interest Groups, Working Groups, and Committees), and establish
  transparency and accountability policies for such groups
* Define, evolve, and defend a Code of Conduct, which must include a neutral,
  unbiased process for resolving conflicts
* Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including how
  contributors become committers/maintainers, approvers, reviewers, members,
  etc.
* Decide, for the purpose of elections, who is a member of standing of the
  Kubernetes project, and what privileges that entails
* Decide which sub-projects are part of the Kubernetes project, including
  accepting new sub-projects and pruning existing sub-projects to maintain
  community focus
* Decide how and when official releases of Kubernetes artifacts are made and
  what they include
* Control access to, establish processes regarding, and provide a final
  escalation path for any Kubernetes repository, which currently includes all
  repositories under the github organizations kubernetes, kubernetes-incubator,
  kubernetes-security, kubernetes-client, etc. and is expected to expand in the
  future
* Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding other
  project resources/assets, including artifact repositories, build and test
  infrastructure, web sites and their domains, blogs, social-media accounts,
  etc.
* Define what a conformant Kubernetes cluster is as part of any certification
  process
* Manage the Kubernetes brand to decide which things can be called “Kubernetes”
  and how that mark can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors.
* Declare a release, so that the committee can ensure quality/feature/other
  requirements are met.
* Request funds and other support from the CNCF (e.g. marketing, press, etc.)
